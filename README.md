# Structure Helpers

## Usage
This mod is intended to be included in other mods. 

Currently the mod adds one structure processor, `robosky.structurehelpers.RandomChanceProcessor`, 
which allows blocks of the modder's choice to be replaced with a random selection from a pool with predefined weights.

Examples where this would be useful include vanilla strongholds, which use a similar random table to pick between
stone brick variants.

Dependency information will be provided once a maven exists. For now, get the binary from github releases.
